This project was simply a test to see if I could do http cloning of a git repository, and query information about a file on it in rails.
Specifically, I wanted to get this working on heroku.
I might integrate this into another project I'm working on, I might not. We shall see.

I also was experimenting with using a singleton initializer for constants rather than putting it all in the Rails.application or in ENV variables (based from code-dot-org).
